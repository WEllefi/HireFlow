This Project aims to improve the recruitment process using a data-driven solution. :briefcase: </br>
## Description of the Project

In the realm of the recruitment industry, the prevailing methodologies exhibit limitations in effectively managing extensive datasets. These approaches necessitate manual intervention for the screening and assessment of resumes, resulting in a protracted and inefficient procedure. As the volume of candidates escalates, the recruitment team grapples with the challenge of retaining comprehensive insights into each individual applicant. Conversely, job seekers invest substantial time in identifying employment opportunities that align with their profiles.

This project illuminates the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in mitigating these challenges. By harnessing the power of AI and Data Analysis, the time investment required for evaluating a candidate’s profile by HR personnel can be significantly curtailed from an average of approximately 7 minutes to a task seamlessly executed by artificial intelligence. This transition not only expedites the evaluation process but also streamlines it into an automated workflow.

Moreover, this research delves into the augmentation of job seekers’ experiences through the implementation of recommendation and matching algorithms. By leveraging these advanced algorithms, the likelihood of identifying fitting job opportunities is substantially enhanced. Consequently, job seekers are empowered to navigate the employment landscape more efficiently and with a heightened probability of securing positions that harmonize with their qualifications and aspirations.

In summation, this project demonstrates the efficacy of integrating artificial intelligence and data analysis into the recruitment domain to revolutionize candidate evaluation, optimize resource utilization, and amplify the efficacy of job matching for enhanced outcomes.

## What Does This Project Provides

This project provides three main services:

1. **AI-Based Candidate Selection:** An AI-based solution that selects the top *n* candidates that match the job requirements. This service helps recruiters streamline the candidate selection process and focus on the most suitable candidates.

2. **Interactive Dashboard:** An interactive dashboard that helps recruiters gain insights and information about the candidates. The dashboard provides visualizations and analytics to aid in decision-making and candidate evaluation.

3. **Robust Recommender System:** A robust recommender system that helps candidates find the most suitable job offers. The system uses machine learning algorithms to recommend job offers based on the candidate's skills, experience, and preferences.

## Data Sources

It is important to note that the data utilized in this project is publicly available and obtained
from reliable sources on the Internet. The decision to use public data stems from the need to work with real-world information that
is accessible to the wider research community. By utilizing publicly available data, we ensure
that the findings and insights derived from our analysis can be validated and reproduced by
others in the field.

To gain a deeper understanding of the data, we will conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA). Through EDA, we aim to uncover valuable insights, detect outliers, understand the distribution
of variables, and identify any missing or inconsistent values.

The data used in this project can be categorized into two main data sets: job offer data and job
seeker data.

The job offer data provides insights into the various job opportunities available in the market.
It includes details such as the location of the job, job titles, descriptions, salary ranges,
required experience, and other relevant attributes. This data is sourced from reputable job portals,
industry-specific websites such as Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and Indeed.

On the other hand, job seeker data focuses on individuals seeking employment. This data
encompasses information related to job seekers, including their resumes, job titles, fields of
expertise, age, salary expectations, and other pertinent details. The job seeker data is typically
sourced through surveys or online profiles. Analyzing this data provides insights into the characteristics,
preferences, and qualifications of job seekers, allowing us to match their profiles with suitable job opportunities.

By dividing the data into these two major data sets, we can effectively analyze and address
the needs of both job seekers and employers. Understanding the job offer data enables us to
provide personalized job recommendations to job seekers based on their qualifications, preferences,
and the specific requirements of available job opportunities. Simultaneously, the job
seeker data helps us assess the profiles and qualifications of candidates and assists recruiters in
identifying the most suitable candidates for their job openings.
